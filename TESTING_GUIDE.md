## üîç **What to Look For**

### **‚úÖ SUCCESS INDICATORS**
- **Gasless transactions**: No MetaMask popups for predictions
- **Unique contracts**: Each market shows different contract address
- **Transaction links**: All Basescan links work and show correct contracts
- **Multi-market approvals**: Single approval enables multiple market trading
- **Database sync**: All predictions persist across page refreshes
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks when things go wrong

### **‚ùå FAILURE SIGNS**
- **Demo contract usage**: All transactions going to `0x688B4b38b8f73878Cd19ef7250FA63D6b36361d1` (current demo market)
- **Wallet popups**: MetaMask requesting approval for every prediction
- **Transaction failures**: "Transaction failed" or "Not eligible for sponsorship"
- **Data loss**: Predictions don't persist after page refresh
- **Contract errors**: Invalid contract addresses or validation failures

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Gasless Transactions Failing**
```
‚ùå Issue: "Transaction not eligible for sponsorship"
‚úÖ Solution: 
1. Check Coinbase Developer Platform allowlist
2. Verify contract addresses are approved
3. Confirm daily spending limits not exceeded
```

### **Market Creation Not Working**
```
‚ùå Issue: "Failed to extract contract address"
‚úÖ Solution:
1. Check MarketFactory deployment
2. Verify event parsing in market-factory.ts
3. Confirm paymaster covers createMarket() function
```


## üìä **Expected Test Results**

### **Successful Production Test**
- ‚úÖ 5+ gasless predictions executed
- ‚úÖ 1+ market created with unique contract
- ‚úÖ All data persisting in database
- ‚úÖ Transaction links pointing to correct contracts

### **Performance Metrics**
- **Market creation**: ~10-15 seconds (including contract deployment)
- **Prediction execution**: ~3-5 seconds (gasless)
- **Page load time**: <2 seconds with cached data

## üöÄ **Next Steps After Successful Testing**

### **If All Tests Pass:**
1. **Deploy to production** (Vercel/similar)
2. **Configure mainnet contracts** for real trading
3. **Update paymaster limits** for mainnet usage
4. **Monitor gas sponsorship** costs and user adoption

### **If Tests Fail:**
1. **Check browser console** for error details
2. **Verify Coinbase Paymaster** allowlist configuration
3. **Review transaction logs** on Basescan
4. **Test with different wallet** to isolate issues
