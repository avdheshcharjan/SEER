- ‚ùå **3.3** Market creation failed with gas estimation error
- ‚ùå **3.4** No new market created to verify in swipe stack

**Console Errors**:
```
üè≠ Creating new prediction market: Will BTC be above $100000 by 21/09/2025?
‚ö° Executing gasless market creation...
‚ùå Market creation failed: Error: precheck failed: preVerificationGas is 21000 but must be at least 21738
```

**Status**: Market creation functionality initiated correctly but failed on gas estimation - matches troubleshooting scenarios.

### **Phase 4: Gasless Prediction Testing** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ **4.1** Successfully accessed prediction markets interface
- ‚úÖ **4.2** Multiple prediction markets loaded and displayed:
  - POLITICS: "Will China invade Taiwan before 2025?" (8% YES, 92% NO)
  - CRYPTO: "Will Dogecoin reach $1 in 2024?" (15% YES, 85% NO)  
  - SPORTS: "Will Manchester City win Champions League?" (41% YES, 59% NO)
- ‚ùå **4.3** Could not successfully execute swipe gestures for predictions
- ‚ùå **4.4** Unable to test gasless prediction functionality

**Technical Issues**:
- Swipe interface requires touch/mobile interactions
- Playwright drag/drop operations not working with the swipe UI
- Arrow key navigation not responsive
- Card click interactions not triggering predictions

**Status**: Interface loads correctly but swipe functionality not testable via browser automation.

## ‚è≥ **Incomplete Test Phases**

### **Phase 5: Database Integration Verification** ‚è≥ NOT STARTED
**Remaining Tasks**:
- [ ] **5.1** Check Profile section for prediction history
- [ ] **5.2** Verify data persistence across page refreshes
- [ ] **5.3** Confirm Supabase integration working
- [ ] **5.4** Verify approval status persistence

**Blocker**: Need to complete successful predictions first to have data to verify.

---

### **Phase 6: Error Handling & Edge Cases** ‚è≥ NOT STARTED  
**Remaining Tasks**:
- [ ] **6.1** Test with insufficient USDC balance
- [ ] **6.2** Test network switching behavior
- [ ] **6.3** Test wallet disconnection scenarios

**Status**: Can be tested independently of prediction functionality.

---

## üîç **Key Issues Identified**

### **‚ùå Critical Failures**
1. **USDC Approval System**: Multi-market approval completely failing
2. **Market Creation**: Gas estimation errors preventing contract deployment
3. **Gasless Predictions**: Cannot test due to swipe interface limitations and approval failures

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Challenges**
1. **Swipe Interface**: Requires mobile/touch interactions not easily automated
2. **Gas Estimation**: preVerificationGas calculation issues
3. **Paymaster Integration**: Approval and creation functions not properly sponsored

### **‚úÖ Working Components**
1. **Wallet Connection**: OnchainKit integration working perfectly
2. **UI/UX**: All interfaces load correctly and display proper content
3. **Error Handling**: Appropriate error messages displayed to users
4. **Market Display**: Prediction markets render with correct data

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting Recommendations**

Based on testing guide troubleshooting section:

### **For USDC Approval Failures**:
1. Check Coinbase Developer Platform allowlist configuration
2. Verify USDC contract address on Base Sepolia
3. Confirm paymaster covers approve() function calls
4. Review approval manager batch logic

### **For Market Creation Failures**:  
1. Verify MarketFactory deployment on Base Sepolia
2. Check event parsing in market-factory.ts
3. Confirm paymaster covers createMarket() function
4. Review gas estimation logic

### **For Testing Continuation**:
1. Consider mobile device testing for swipe functionality
2. Implement manual testing for prediction flows
3. Test with different wallet addresses
4. Verify mainnet vs testnet configuration
